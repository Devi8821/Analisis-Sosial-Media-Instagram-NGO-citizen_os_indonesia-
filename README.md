# 📊 Instagram Analysis of NGO @citizen_os_indonesia (Oct 2024 – 2025)

In the past few months, I’ve been exploring how data analytics can empower public communication — turning numbers into stories that matter.
To do that, I conducted a social media analysis for the NGO Citizen OS Indonesia, an organization focused on digital democracy and civic participation. 
Using Instagram scraping (JSON format), I collected and analyzed the data through Python (Jupyter Notebook) to uncover insights about public engagement, content performance, and participation trends.
